# CharGen5e
Simple character generator for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition

This script will:
- Roll up six scores using the 4d6-drop-lowest method
- Automatically assign them to the six abilities
- Select a name, level, race, and class
- Output the result and note what build the character has, ability-wise

Future Features:
- Allow user to choose between automatically assigned stats and manually allocated scores
- Add races and classes from non-PHB materials, and a mechanism for deciding whether to use them
- Allow assignment of a given name based on character's race
- Evaluate whether the race, class, and stats come together to form a "good" build; for instance, a Half-Orc (boosted CON and STR) Wizard (requires high INT) with a CHA build will not be terribly effective, but might be entertaining
- Add racial bonuses to ability scores
- Add class features based on level, including Ability Score Improvements/optional feats
